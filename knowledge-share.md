### Why do knowlege sharing session fail
- not enough motivation
- don't know what to talk about
- lack of interaction, no response from the audience, lack of context and understanding in audience

### How do we make this easier for everyone
- having a topic pool and let people vote on it, but feel free to choose your own topic
- volunteer first then potientially having a roaster between squads, no expectations of engineering only presentations
- structured template (optional)
- having a host to support the presenter (optional)
- recording the session 
- try our best not skipping a session and build the momentum
- presenters provide resources & references beforehand
